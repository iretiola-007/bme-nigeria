  <!-- Introduction / Problem Section -->
  <section id="introduction">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="typewriter-heading">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Nigeria's healthcare system faces persistent 
        structural challenges including limited access 
        to advanced medical equipment, heavy dependence 
        on imported technologies, and gaps in maintenance 
        and technical support. A strategic focus on Biomedical 
        Engineering presents a critical opportunity for 
        strengthening Nigeria's healthcare infrastructure 
        and long-term resilience.</p>

  <!-- What is Biomedical Engineering -->
  <section id="definition">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="typewriter-heading">What is Biomedical Engineering?</h2>
      <p>Biomedical Engineering is an interdisciplinary field that 
        applies principles of engineering, biology, and medicine 
        to design, develop, and maintain technologies for healthcare. 
        It encompasses areas such as medical imaging, bioinstrumentation, 
        biomaterials, prosthetics, rehabilitation engineering, healthcare 
        robotics, and diagnostic devices.
      </p> 
      <p>The discipline bridges the 
        gap between engineering innovation and clinical application, 
        ensuring that medical tools are not only functional but also safe, 
        reliable, and accessible to patients and healthcare providers.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Current State in Nigeria -->
  <section id="current-state">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="typewriter-heading">The Current State of Medical Equipment in Nigeria</h2>
      <p>Many hospitals rely heavily on imported equipment, which often 
        lacks locally trained personnel for proper operation and 
        maintenance. Critical diagnostic tools such as imaging 
        machines, laboratory analyzers, and life-support systems are 
        frequently underutilized or nonfunctional due to maintenance 
        gaps and resource constraints.</p>
      <p>Additionally, research and development in medical technologies 
        remain limited, with few platforms supporting innovation, 
        prototyping, or local manufacturing of biomedical devices.</p>
      <p>These limitations affect both patient care and the overall 
        resilience of the healthcare system, emphasizing the need 
        for strategic investment in engineering solutions tailored 
        to Nigeria's specific needs.</p>

  <!-- Global Biomedical Innovation Models -->
  <section id="global-models">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="typewriter-heading">Global Biomedical Innovation Models</h2>
      <p>Countries and universities with structured biomedical research 
        ecosystems demonstrate how coordinated research, funding, and 
        industry collaboration can drive medical innovation. Institutions 
        such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University, 
        and Stanford University exemplify environments where biomedical 
        research thrives through university–industry partnerships, sustained 
        research funding, startup ecosystems, and clinical collaboration. 
        Even regional research universities, such as the University of 
        Nevada, Reno, contribute meaningfully by supporting biomedical 
        research initiatives in areas like biosensors, medical imaging, 
        and translational health sciences, demonstrating that innovation 
        can occur at multiple scales. The purpose of examining these 
        models is not to suggest that other countries are “better,” but 
        to illustrate how strong biomedical ecosystems are structured 
        to maximize research impact and improve healthcare outcomes.</p>

  <!-- Research Funding & Limitations -->
  <section id="funding">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="typewriter-heading">Research Funding and Limitations in Nigeria</h2>
      <p>Despite growing interest, funding in Nigeria remains 
        limited and inconsistent. Most universities and research 
        institutions rely on small government grants, ad hoc 
        industry support, or international partnerships to 
        carry out projects. The lack of sustainable financing 
        restricts the scale and impact of biomedical innovation.</p>

  <!-- Nigeria’s Academic Capacity -->
  <section id="academic-capacity">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="typewriter-heading">Nigeria's Existing Academic Capacity</h2>
      <p>Nigeria already has several institutions offering 
        biomedical engineering programs or related research 
        opportunities, demonstrating that the country possesses 
        both talent and academic infrastructure. Notable 
        examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>University of Lagos</li>
        <li>University of Ibadan</li>
        <li>Federal University of Technology, Minna</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These universities provide foundational training, 
        laboratories, and small-scale research projects in 
        biomedical engineering. While infrastructure and 
        funding limitations exist, these institutions 
        highlight that Nigeria already has a base upon 
        which more robust biomedical innovation ecosystems 
        could be built.</p>

  <!-- Why Biomedical Engineering Deserves Attention -->
  <section id="importance">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="typewriter-heading">Why Biomedical Engineering Deserves Greater Attention</h2>
      <p>Biomedical engineering is uniquely positioned to address Nigeria’s 
        healthcare challenges by integrating engineering, 
        technology, and clinical practice to improve access to affordable 
        diagnostic tools, develop low-cost prosthetics and rehabilitation 
        devices, create locally maintainable medical equipment, advance 
        digital health solutions and AI-driven healthcare innovations.</p> 
      <p>A review of Nigeria’s healthcare infrastructure and research 
        landscape suggests that Biomedical Engineering warrants increased 
        strategic investment and institutional prioritization. With 
        targeted efforts, it can strengthen the healthcare system, 
        reduce reliance on imports, and create sustainable innovation 
        pathways for the country.</p>
